This docker produces avro files from a specified bak file.  The avro files are produced by first
restoring the bak file to an mssql instance.  Please ensure that there is sufficient memory for the
mssql instance as well as the bak file that is being restored.

To use:
1) Ensure that you have enough disk space for mssql instance + bak file restore.  Start with 50G for modest size backup.

2) Update run_docker.sh with the following. The LOCAL_SRC and LOCAL_DEST directories will be mounted in the docker container.
	- BAKFILE - name of bakfile without the path
	- LOCAL_SRC - path to the BAKFILE
	- LOCAL_DEST - directory for the avro files

3) Copy db-to-avro-2.0.jar into this directory

4) Run from this directory
	sudo ./docker-run.sh

5) To track progess
	sudo docker logs mssqlbak_avro -f

6) To dump container logs at the end
	sudo docker logs mssqlbak_avro > $YOUR_LOGFILE
